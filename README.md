# C-Program

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

When summarizing the project, I find it was to create an application that would calculate the users investment and display there earnings overtime. Specifically, the problem the application or project was trying to solve was that it needed to take the users initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interets, and number of years and calculate the year end balance and year end earned interest based on that amount. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

I find that I did a good job displaying the program's functionality through the use of in-line comments and in creating the correct functions that would calculate the user's investment overtime. Additionally, I find that I did a good job in creating code that would displayed an organized menu of the user's investment growth based on applications calculations.  

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Based on instuctor feedback, I find that I could further enhance my code by replacing the spaces which displayed the year, year end balance, and year end earned interest to the user with \t statements. Additionally, I could further create more functions that could validate the user input and ensure that they are typing in the appropriate information in order for my program to function properly. In turn, these enchancements would improve my code's functionality and demonstrate my program in a more logical or organized manner.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The only challenging piece when writing the code at first was finding out how to calculate the users investment based on their input and in a yearly amount. In turn, with the help of Zybooks and resources materials provided to me in the course, I find that I was able to visualize my code at first but was not able to get the correct analysis or answers based on the user's investment information. As a result, while I got frustrated, I took short 5 min breaks and was eventually able to figure out what I was doing wrong.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills from the project that are transferable to other projects or coures I take would be problem-solving, attention to detail, time management, and critical thinking. In turn, these skills will not only be important in future projects or courses I take, but will be required once I move to the professional field or working enviroment as a Software Engineer.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using correct programming functionality such as in using if-else statments or for loops, using in-line comments, using good variable names, and ensuring that there is no whitespace. In summary, these allowed my code to be displayed in a professional manner and further helped me create code that had less errors overall.
